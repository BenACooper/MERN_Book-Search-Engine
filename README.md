# Book Search Engine

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can search for books by title or author and view information about each book. Registered users can save books to their profile for future reference.

This application was initially built using a RESTful API but has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server for more efficient data queries and mutations.
